### Study Guide for Network Security (CompTIA Security+)

#### Chapter 12: Network Security

---

**1. What is the Zero Trust model?**  
**Answer:** The Zero Trust model is a security concept that requires all users, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted or maintaining access to applications and data. It operates on the principles of least privilege and assumes that threats could be internal or external [[5]].

---

**2. What are the key components of the Zero Trust Control Plane?**  
**Answer:** The Control Plane consists of:
- Adaptive identity (adaptive authentication)
- Threat scope reduction (limited blast radius)
- Policy-driven access control
- Policy engines and policy administrators [[17]].

---

**3. Describe the purpose of network segmentation.**  
**Answer:** Network segmentation divides a network into logical or physical groupings based on trust boundaries, functional requirements, or other criteria to help apply security controls and assist with functionality [[13]].

**4. What is the difference between a honeypot and a honeynet?**  
**Answer:** A honeypot is a single system designed to appear vulnerable and is monitored to collect data on attacks. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots, providing a more extensive environment for collecting information about attacker methods [[38]].

---

**5. Explain what a DDoS attack is and how it operates.**  
**Answer:** A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic from multiple sources. These attacks can be volume-based (e.g., UDP floods) or protocol-based (e.g., SYN floods) [[60]].

---

**6. What are the characteristics of stateful and stateless firewalls?**  
**Answer:** 
- **Stateless firewalls** filter packets based on preset rules without maintaining the state of active connections. They analyze each packet individually.
- **Stateful firewalls** keep track of the state of active connections and make filtering decisions based on the context of the traffic [[35]].

---

**7. What is the function of a load balancer?**  
**Answer:** A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby enhancing availability and reliability of applications [[27]].

---

**8. Describe how VPNs provide secure remote access.**  
**Answer:** Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) create a secure, encrypted tunnel over the internet for remote users to connect to a private network, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity even when traversing untrusted networks [[24]].

---

**9. What are the main differences between IPSec and SSL/TLS?**  
**Answer:** 
- **IPSec** operates at the network layer and is commonly used for site-to-site VPNs, requiring a client and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- **SSL/TLS** operates at the transport layer and is used primarily for securing web traffic (HTTPS), allowing for secure connections without needing a dedicated client [[49]].

---

**10. What is the significance of DNSSEC?**  
**Answer:** Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) adds a layer of security to prevent DNS data from being spoofed or altered, ensuring the authenticity of DNS responses [[40]].
