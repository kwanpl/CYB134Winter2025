#### Questions and Answers

1. **What are the three key objectives of cybersecurity known as the CIA triad?**
   - **Answer:** The three key objectives are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability [[4]].

2. **Define confidentiality in the context of cybersecurity.**
   - **Answer:** Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information [[3]].

3. **What is meant by integrity in cybersecurity?**
   - **Answer:** Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally [[4]].

4. **Explain availability in cybersecurity terms.**
   - **Answer:** Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them [[4]].

5. **What does non-repudiation mean in cybersecurity?**
   - **Answer:** Non-repudiation means that someone who performed an action cannot later deny having taken that action, often ensured through digital signatures [[4]].

6. **What are the different categories of security controls?**
   - **Answer:** The categories of security controls include Technical, Operational, Managerial, and Physical controls [[11]].

7. **Name and describe the types of security controls.**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Preventive Controls:** Stop security issues before they occur (e.g., firewalls).
     - **Detective Controls:** Identify security events that have occurred (e.g., intrusion detection systems).
     - **Corrective Controls:** Remediate security issues that have occurred (e.g., restoring backups).
     - **Deterrent Controls:** Prevent an attacker from attempting to violate security policies (e.g., guard dogs).
     - **Compensating Controls:** Mitigate risks associated with exceptions made to a security policy [[13]].

8. **What is a gap analysis in cybersecurity?**
   - **Answer:** A gap analysis evaluates security controls by reviewing control objectives and examining actual controls to identify any discrepancies or gaps [[10]].

9. **What are the three states of data and their descriptions?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Data at Rest:** Stored data on hard drives or other media.
     - **Data in Transit:** Data moving over a network.
     - **Data in Use:** Data actively being processed by a computer system [[15]].

10. **How do Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems work?**
    - **Answer:** DLP systems enforce information handling policies to prevent data loss, monitoring both stored sensitive information and network traffic for unauthorized transmissions [[15]].

11. **What are the potential impacts of a security incident?**
    - **Answer:** Impacts can include financial, reputational, strategic, operational, and compliance risks [[9]].

12. **What is the DAD triad, and how does it relate to the CIA triad?**
    - **Answer:** The DAD triad includes Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial, which correspond to breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, respectively [[6]].

13. **What is the purpose of access restrictions?**
    - **Answer:** Access restrictions limit the ability of individuals or systems to access sensitive information or resources to minimize the risk of data breaches [[18]].

14. **What technique is used to transform sensitive data into a non-retrievable format?**
    - **Answer:** Data obfuscation techniques, such as hashing and tokenization, are used to transform sensitive data [[17]].

15. **What should organizations do with sensitive data that is no longer needed?**
    - **Answer:** Organizations should destroy data when it is no longer necessary or transform it to a deidentified format to minimize risk [[15]].

#### Exam Essentials
- Remember that the three core objectives of cybersecurity are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which collectively form the CIA triad [[19]].
