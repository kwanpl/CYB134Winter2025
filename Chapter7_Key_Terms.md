1. **Cryptography**: The practice of encoding information in a manner that it cannot be decoded without access to the required decryption key. It consists of two main operations: encryption (transforming plain-text into ciphertext) and decryption (transforming ciphertext back into plain text) [[2]].

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: A framework that provides the necessary components for secure communication through the use of public and private keys, key escrow, and digital certificates [[1]].

3. **Encryption**: The process of converting plain text into ciphertext using an encryption key. Various types of encryption include full-disk, partition, file, volume, database, and record encryption [[1]], [[12]].

4. **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plain text using a decryption key [[2]].

5. **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: A type of encryption that uses a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption [[22]].

6. **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: A type of encryption that uses a pair of keys—public and private keys—for secure communication. The public key is shared, while the private key is kept secret [[23]].

7. **Digital Signature**: A cryptographic mechanism that provides non-repudiation by allowing the recipient to verify that a message came from a specific sender and was not altered in transit [[38]].

8. **Hash Function**: A one-way cryptographic function that takes an input of any length and produces a fixed-length output, known as a message digest [[36]].

9. **Collision**: A situation in which two different inputs produce the same hash value, which can compromise the integrity of the hash function [[37]].

10. **Steganography**: The practice of concealing messages within another file, such that it is not apparent that a message is present [[9]].

11. **Key Escrow**: A method of storing cryptographic keys with a trusted third party to allow for recovery of encrypted data if the key is lost [[31]].

12. **Certificate Authority (CA)**: An entity that issues digital certificates, verifying the identity of the certificate owner [[43]].

13. **Digital Certificate**: An electronic document that uses a digital signature to provide the recipient with assurance of the sender's identity. It includes the public key and other identifying information [[42]].

14. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: A protocol that protects data in transit by encrypting the communication between systems [[12]].

15. **Key Length**: The size of the cryptographic key, measured in bits, which determines the strength of the encryption. Longer keys provide greater security [[18]].

16. **Obfuscation**: The practice of making data or code intentionally difficult to understand, often used to protect intellectual property [[13]].

17. **Non-repudiation**: A property of cryptographic mechanisms that ensures a sender cannot deny having sent a message, and a recipient cannot deny receiving it [[17]].

18. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel [[30]].

19. **HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)**: A mechanism that combines a hashing algorithm with a secret key to provide message integrity during transmission [[40]].

20. **Blockchain**: A distributed and immutable open public ledger used to securely store records without the possibility of tampering [[57]].
