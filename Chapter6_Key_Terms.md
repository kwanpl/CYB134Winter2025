1. **Application Security**: The practice of protecting applications from threats throughout their lifecycle, ensuring they are designed, developed, and deployed securely. [[1]]

2. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: A process used to design, create, support, and maintain software, which includes planning, requirements definition, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. [[3]]

3. **Static Code Analysis**: A method of testing software that involves reviewing the source code without executing the program, allowing for the identification of potential vulnerabilities and issues. [[12]]

4. **Dynamic Code Analysis**: Testing of the code by executing it with various inputs to identify runtime vulnerabilities and issues. [[12]]

5. **Fuzzing**: A testing technique that involves sending invalid or random data to an application to determine how it handles unexpected inputs, often used to discover vulnerabilities. [[12]]

6. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: A type of attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious SQL statements that control a database server's behavior, often by manipulating input fields. [[14]]

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, often to steal information or perform actions on behalf of the user. [[33]]

8. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: An attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated, using the user's credentials without their consent. [[37]]

9. **Buffer Overflow**: A situation where a program writes more data to a block of memory, or buffer, than it was allocated for, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to vulnerabilities. [[52]]

10. **Race Condition**: A situation that occurs when the behavior of software depends on the timing of events, often leading to vulnerabilities if access permissions are not consistently enforced. [[52]]

11. **Unvalidated Redirects**: A vulnerability where an application allows users to be redirected to untrusted sites without proper validation, which can lead to phishing attacks. [[27]]

12. **Input Validation**: The process of ensuring that user input is correct and safe before processing it by the application, essential for preventing various attacks. [[39]]

13. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: A security tool that filters and monitors HTTP traffic to and from a web application, helping to protect against common attacks. [[41]]

14. **Code Signing**: A security measure that uses cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of software, ensuring it has not been altered. [[44]]

15. **Sandboxing**: The practice of running applications in a controlled environment to prevent them from affecting other parts of the system and to safely test untrusted software. [[43]]

16. **Memory Management**: The process by which an application handles its own memory usage, which is crucial for preventing vulnerabilities such as memory leaks and pointer dereferencing issues. [[50]]

17. **Parameterized Queries**: A method of interacting with databases that separates SQL code from data, helping to prevent SQL injection attacks. [[43]]
