### Study Guide: Wireless and Mobile Security

#### Chapter 13: Wireless and Mobile Security

---

**1. What are the key vulnerabilities associated with mobile devices?**  
**Answer:** Common vulnerabilities include sideloading and jailbreaking. Sideloading allows the installation of applications outside of official app stores, while jailbreaking exploits vulnerabilities in the operating system to gain unauthorized access [[1]].

---

**2. Describe the different mobile device deployment models.**  
**Answer:** 
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):** Users bring their personal devices, which the organization does not control.
- **CYOD (Choose Your Own Device):** The organization owns the devices, but users can choose from a set of approved options.
- **COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled):** The organization owns and manages the devices but allows reasonable personal use.
- **Fully Corporate-Owned:** The organization controls and manages the devices with no personal use allowed [[26]].

**3. What are some common wireless connectivity options?**  
**Answer:** Common options include:
- **Cellular Networks:** Used for mobile devices, divided into cells with coverage by towers (e.g., 4G, 5G).
- **Wi-Fi:** Provides wireless networking primarily using 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
- **Bluetooth:** A short-range, low-power connection used for devices like headsets [[3]].

---

**4. What is the difference between WPA2 and WPA3 security protocols?**  
**Answer:** 
- **WPA2:** Uses a pre-shared key (PSK) or relies on RADIUS for enterprise authentication. It employs CCMP with AES encryption.
- **WPA3:** Introduces Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for stronger password protection and perfect forward secrecy, enhancing security against brute-force attacks [[20]].

---

**5. What are some common attacks against wireless networks?**  
**Answer:** Common attacks include:
- **Evil Twin Attacks:** Malicious access points impersonating legitimate ones to capture user data.
- **Rogue Access Points:** Unauthorized APs that can be added to the network.
- **Bluetooth Attacks:** Such as bluejacking (sending unsolicited messages) and bluesnarfing (unauthorized access to information) [[12]].

**6. Why is conducting a site survey important in wireless network design?**  
**Answer:** A site survey helps identify existing networks, signal strengths, and the physical layout of the facility. This information is crucial for optimal access point placement and to avoid interference [[16]].

---

**7. What security features should be implemented for wireless access points (APs)?**  
**Answer:** Security features include changing default settings, disabling insecure protocols, using strong passwords, and regularly updating and patching the devices [[20]].

---

**8. Explain the concept of geolocation and its uses in mobile devices.**  
**Answer:** Geolocation determines a device's location using GPS and other data. It is useful for location-aware authentication, geofencing, and tracking lost devices [[8]].

---

**9. What are the four security modes of Bluetooth?**  
**Answer:** 
- **Security Mode 1:** No security.
- **Security Mode 2:** Service-level enforced security.
- **Security Mode 3:** Link-level enforced security.
- **Security Mode 4:** Standard pairing with Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) [[5]].

---

**10. What best practices should be followed for hardening mobile devices?**  
**Answer:** Best practices include:
- Regularly updating and patching the OS.
- Enabling remote wipe functionality.
- Requiring strong passcodes.
- Setting automatic screen locks.
- Turning off connectivity options (like Bluetooth) when not in use [[28]].
