1. **Incident Response (IR)**: A process and plan for responding to security incidents to minimize their impact and restore normal operations. It includes stages like preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned [[3]].

2. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Artifacts or signs that indicate a potential intrusion or malicious activity within a system. Examples include account lockouts, impossible travel, blocked content, and missing logs [[12]].

3. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: A centralized tool that collects, aggregates, and analyzes log data from various sources to provide security monitoring, alerts, and forensic capabilities [[17]].

4. **Threat Hunting**: The proactive search for indicators of compromise or potential threats within a network that may not be identified by traditional security tools [[11]].

5. **Application Allow List**: A security measure that specifies which applications are permitted to run on a system, blocking all others that are not explicitly allowed [[36]].

6. **Quarantine**: A containment technique where potentially harmful files or systems are isolated to prevent them from causing further damage while allowing for investigation [[37]].

7. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: A method used to identify the underlying reasons for an incident or problem, aiming to rectify issues and prevent future occurrences [[40]].

8. **Log Aggregation**: The process of collecting and centralizing log data from various sources to aid in incident analysis and monitoring [[34]].

9. **Monitoring Computing Resources**: The practice of observing and analyzing the performance and security of systems, applications, and infrastructure to detect anomalies and incidents [[17]].

10. **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: A strategy and plan for restoring IT systems and operations after a significant disruption or disaster, focusing on the recovery of services [[10]].

11. **Business Continuity (BC)**: A plan that ensures essential functions continue during and after a disaster or incident, maintaining operations with minimal disruption [[10]].

12. **Configuration Change**: Adjustments made to the settings or rules of systems and devices to improve security or address vulnerabilities following an incident [[38]].

13. **Incident Response Team**: A group of professionals designated to handle and respond to security incidents, typically including management, information security staff, technical experts, and legal advisors [[7]].
