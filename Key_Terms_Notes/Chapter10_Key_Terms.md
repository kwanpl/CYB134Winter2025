1. **Cloud Computing**: A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [[2]].

2. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: A cloud service model that allows customers to purchase and interact with the basic building blocks of a technology infrastructure, including computing, storage, and networks, while the provider manages the underlying hardware [[7]].

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: A cloud service model that provides customers with access to fully managed applications running in the cloud, where the provider is responsible for everything from the operation of the physical datacenters to the performance management of the application [[8]].

4. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: A cloud service model that offers a platform for customers to run applications they have developed themselves, with the cloud service provider managing the infrastructure [[8]].

5. **Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs)**: Software tools that serve as intermediaries between cloud service users and cloud service providers, allowing them to monitor user activity and enforce policy requirements [[41]].

6. **Shared Responsibility Model**: An operating environment in which responsibilities for security are divided between cloud service providers and customers, with specific responsibilities assigned to each party based on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) [[17]].

7. **Virtualization**: A technology that allows multiple guest systems to share the same underlying hardware by running on a hypervisor, which mediates access to the hardware [[21]].

8. **Hypervisor**: A special operating system that runs on virtual host hardware and allows the creation and management of virtual machines while enforcing isolation between them [[22]].

9. **Containerization**: A form of application-level virtualization that packages applications into containers, allowing them to be portable across different operating systems and hardware [[24]].

10. **Data Sovereignty**: A principle stating that data is subject to the legal restrictions of any jurisdiction where it is collected, stored, or processed [[37]].

11. **Resource Policies**: Security measures offered by cloud providers that customers can use to limit the actions that users of their accounts may take, enhancing security against unauthorized access or accidental actions [[42]].

12. **Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)**: Organizations that offer outsourced security services such as monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response [[10]].

13. **Elasticity**: The ability of cloud systems to automatically adjust resources based on demand, optimizing costs and performance [[4]].

14. **Multitenancy**: A cloud computing architecture where multiple customers share the same physical resources while remaining isolated from each other [[3]].

15. **Edge Computing**: A distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth [[21]].
