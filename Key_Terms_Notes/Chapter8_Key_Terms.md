1. **Identity** - The set of claims made about a subject, which can include individuals, applications, devices, systems, or organizations. Identities are linked to attributes that describe the subject [[3]].

2. **Authentication** - The process of proving that an identity belongs to a user by verifying their credentials, such as passwords, tokens, or biometric factors [[4]].

3. **Authorization** - The process that verifies what resources and permissions an authenticated user is allowed to access or perform actions on [[5]].

4. **Accounting** - The tracking of user actions and resource utilization, including monitoring time, bandwidth, or CPU usage [[8]].

5. **Access Control** - A security measure that determines which users, services, or programs can access specific resources or perform certain actions [[33]].

6. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - An access control scheme where permissions are assigned based on the roles of users within an organization [[34]].

7. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** - A type of access control where access rights are regulated by a central authority based on multiple levels of security [[34]].

8. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** - A type of access control that allows the owner of a resource to dictate who has access to it [[34]].

9. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** - An access control scheme that uses policies based on user attributes to determine access rights [[35]].

10. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** - A security mechanism that requires two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, enhancing security beyond just passwords [[21]].

11. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - A user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials [[10]].

12. **Federation** - A system that allows identity information to be shared across multiple domains or organizations, enabling users to use their identity across different services [[13]].

13. **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** - Tools and processes used to manage and monitor privileged accounts, ensuring that the principle of least privilege is maintained [[32]].

14. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Permissions** - Permissions that are granted only when needed and are revoked after use, reducing the risk of unauthorized access [[33]].

15. **Password Vaulting** - A security measure that stores passwords securely, allowing users to access privileged accounts without needing to know the password [[33]].

16. **Biometric Authentication** - A method of verifying identity based on unique physical characteristics of the user, such as fingerprints or facial recognition [[27]].

17. **One-Time Passwords (OTP)** - A security mechanism where passwords are generated for one-time use, enhancing security against replay attacks [[23]].

18. **SSH Keys** - Cryptographic keys used in place of passwords for secure shell (SSH) access, enhancing security during remote logins [[4]].

19. **Passwordless Authentication** - An authentication method that eliminates the need for a password, relying instead on tokens, biometrics, or other factors [[19]].

20. **Permission Creep** - A situation where users accumulate more permissions over time than necessary for their current roles, potentially leading to security risks [[31]].
