1. **Confidentiality**: Ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information. Security controls like firewalls and encryption are used to prevent unauthorized access [[3]].

2. **Integrity**: Ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, whether intentional or unintentional. Controls such as hashing and integrity monitoring enforce this requirement [[3]].

3. **Availability**: Ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time they request access. Controls like fault tolerance and backups are employed to maintain availability [[4]].

4. **CIA Triad**: Represents the three core objectives of cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It serves as a foundational model for understanding security [[4]].

5. **Non-repudiation**: The assurance that someone cannot deny having performed an action, such as sending a message. Digital signatures are a common method to achieve non-repudiation [[4]].

6. **Data at Rest**: Refers to stored data that resides on hard drives, tapes, in the cloud, or on other storage media [[15]].

7. **Data in Transit**: Data that is actively moving over a network. It is vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks [[15]].

8. **Data in Use**: Data that is actively being processed by a computer system, which can be accessed while in memory [[15]].

9. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Systems designed to enforce information handling policies to prevent data loss and theft. They monitor for sensitive information and can block unauthorized transmissions [[15]].

10. **Gap Analysis**: A process where cybersecurity professionals review control objectives and evaluate existing controls, identifying any gaps that pose potential risks [[10]].

11. **Security Controls**: Specific measures implemented to fulfill the security objectives of an organization. They can be categorized into technical, operational, managerial, and physical controls [[11]].

12. **Technical Controls**: Security measures that enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the digital realm (e.g., firewalls, encryption) [[11]].

13. **Operational Controls**: Processes implemented to manage technology securely (e.g., user access reviews, log monitoring) [[11]].

14. **Managerial Controls**: Procedural mechanisms focusing on the risk management process (e.g., periodic risk assessments, security planning) [[11]].

15. **Physical Controls**: Security measures that affect the physical world (e.g., fences, locks, surveillance systems) [[11]].

16. **Preventive Controls**: Controls that aim to stop security issues before they occur (e.g., firewalls) [[12]].

17. **Detective Controls**: Controls that identify security events that have already occurred (e.g., intrusion detection systems) [[13]].

18. **Corrective Controls**: Controls that remediate security issues after they have occurred (e.g., restoring backups) [[13]].

19. **Compensating Controls**: Controls designed to mitigate risks associated with exceptions made to security policies [[13]].

20. **Data Minimization**: Techniques aimed at reducing the amount of sensitive information retained by an organization [[15]].
