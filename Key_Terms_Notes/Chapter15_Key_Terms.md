1. **Digital Forensics**: The investigation and analysis of data from digital devices to determine what happened on a system or device, often in response to legal holds, electronic discovery requirements, or as part of incident response [[1]].

2. **Legal Hold**: A notification sent by legal counsel to an organization requiring them to preserve data and records that may be relevant to a current or pending case [[3]].

3. **Chain of Custody**: The documentation process that tracks the handling of evidence to ensure its integrity and admissibility in court. This includes recording every time the evidence is accessed, transferred, or handled [[8]].

4. **E-Discovery**: An electronic discovery process that allows parties in a legal case to obtain evidence from each other and other involved parties, often including the preservation of electronically stored information [[3]].

5. **Order of Volatility**: A concept that describes the likelihood of data being lost due to system operations, helping forensic analysts determine what data to capture first [[6]].

6. **Forensic Data Acquisition**: The process of collecting data using forensic tools to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data for analysis [[5]].

7. **Forensic Tools**: Software and hardware used to acquire and analyze digital forensic data, such as disk and memory imagers [[5]].

8. **Hashing**: A method of creating a unique identifier (hash value) for data that can be used to verify the integrity of the data and ensure that it has not been altered [[18]].

9. **Write Blocker**: A device or software that prevents any writing to a storage device during a forensic examination, ensuring that the original data remains unchanged [[20]].

10. **Slack Space**: The unused space on a storage drive that may contain remnants of previously deleted files, which can be analyzed during forensic investigations [[21]].

11. **Cloud Forensics**: The practice of conducting forensic investigations in cloud environments, which presents unique challenges due to the nature of cloud services and data handling [[10]].

12. **Network Forensics**: The analysis of network traffic and logs to investigate actions or events that took place over a network, often utilizing packet analyzers like Wireshark [[16]].

13. **Timelining**: The process of creating a timeline of events based on timestamps from files and logs to understand the sequence of activities during an investigation [[25]].

14. **Data Recovery**: Techniques used to retrieve lost, deleted, or inaccessible data from storage devices [[21]].

15. **Firmware**: The software programmed into hardware devices that can also be a target for forensic analysis [[8]].
