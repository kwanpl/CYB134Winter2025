1. **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)**: A widely deployed security standard for Wi-Fi networks that provides two major usage modes: WPA2-Personal (uses a pre-shared key) and WPA2-Enterprise (relies on a RADIUS authentication server) [[20]].

2. **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)**: The successor to WPA2, required to be supported in all Wi-Fi devices since mid-2020. It enhances security with features like Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) and perfect forward secrecy [[21]].

3. **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)**: A framework used in wireless networks to provide authentication services, often utilized in conjunction with RADIUS servers [[23]].

4. **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)**: A networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service [[24]].

5. **MDM (Mobile Device Management)**: A type of software used to manage mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, providing features like remote wipe, application management, and security controls [[29]].

6. **UEM (Unified Endpoint Management)**: A management tool that combines mobile devices, desktops, and other types of endpoints into a single management platform [[29]].

7. **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**: A policy that allows employees to use their personal devices for work purposes, which can lead to greater flexibility but also increased security risks [[26]].

8. **CYOD (Choose Your Own Device)**: A model where the organization provides a selection of devices for employees to choose from, allowing some degree of user choice while maintaining control [[26]].

9. **COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled)**: A model in which the organization owns the devices but allows reasonable personal use, balancing control and flexibility [[26]].

10. **Sideloading**: The process of transferring files to a mobile device to install applications outside of official application stores; it can be legitimate or potentially malicious [[15]].

11. **Jailbreaking**: A method to gain root access to a mobile device's operating system, allowing the user to bypass restrictions imposed by the manufacturer [[16]].

12. **Geolocation**: The identification of the geographic location of a device using technologies such as GPS, which can be used for location-aware services [[8]].

13. **Bluetooth**: A short-range wireless technology used for connecting devices, primarily for low-power applications [[5]].

14. **Evil Twin**: A type of attack where a malicious access point mimics a legitimate one, tricking users into connecting to it [[11]].

15. **Disassociation Attack**: An attack that forces a device to disconnect from a wireless access point, which can be used to facilitate other attacks [[14]].

16. **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**: A technology that uses tags and readers to exchange information wirelessly, typically used for tracking and identification [[5]].

17. **NFC (Near-Field Communication)**: A short-range communication technology used for low-bandwidth interactions between devices, commonly seen in mobile payments [[8]].
