1. **Risk**: The combination of a threat and a corresponding vulnerability that creates a potential for loss or harm [[1]].

2. **Threat**: An entity that has the potential to cause harm by exploiting a vulnerability [[1]].

3. **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system or environment that can be exploited by a threat [[1]].

4. **Risk Identification**: The process of identifying threats and vulnerabilities in an organization's operating environment [[2]].

5. **External Risks**: Risks that originate from outside the organization, including hackers and natural disasters [[2]].

6. **Internal Risks**: Risks that originate from within the organization, such as malicious insiders or equipment failures [[2]].

7. **Multiparty Risks**: Risks that affect more than one organization, such as power outages or breaches affecting multiple customers [[2]].

8. **Legacy Systems**: Outdated systems that may not receive security updates and pose unique risks [[2]].

9. **Risk Assessment**: The process of evaluating the likelihood of a risk occurring and the potential impact it could have [[3]].

10. **Likelihood of Occurrence**: The probability that a risk will happen, often expressed as a percentage or a rate [[3]].

11. **Magnitude of Impact**: The potential financial cost or other consequences of a risk if it occurs [[3]].

12. **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**: The expected financial damage each time a risk materializes, calculated by multiplying asset value by exposure factor [[6]].

13. **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**: The total expected loss from a risk over a year, calculated by multiplying SLE by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) [[6]].

14. **Quantitative Risk Analysis**: A method that uses numeric data to assess risks, allowing for straightforward prioritization [[5]].

15. **Qualitative Risk Analysis**: A method that uses subjective judgments and categories to evaluate risks that are difficult to quantify [[5]].

16. **Risk Mitigation**: The process of applying security controls to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk [[11]].

17. **Risk Avoidance**: A strategy that involves changing business practices to eliminate the potential for a risk [[12]].

18. **Risk Transference**: Shifting the impact of a risk to another entity, commonly through insurance [[13]].

19. **Risk Acceptance**: Choosing to take no action regarding a risk, acknowledging it without mitigation [[14]].

20. **Inherent Risk**: The level of risk that exists before any controls are implemented [[15]].

21. **Residual Risk**: The level of risk that remains after controls have been applied [[15]].

22. **Risk Appetite**: The level of risk that an organization is willing to accept as part of its operations [[16]].

23. **Data Inventory**: A list of all types of sensitive information maintained by an organization [[23]].

24. **Data Classification**: The process of organizing data into categories based on sensitivity and impact [[25]].

25. **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: An individual responsible for overseeing data privacy efforts within an organization [[27]].
