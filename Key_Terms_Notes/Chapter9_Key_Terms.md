1. **Resilience**: The ability of an organization to continue operating and recover from disruptions, including natural disasters and human-created incidents. It is a critical part of the availability aspect of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) [[2]].

2. **Redundancy**: Having multiple systems, services, or devices in place to ensure that if one fails, others can take over, thereby maintaining availability [[3]].

3. **High Availability**: A design approach that aims to ensure that systems are continuously operational and available, often achieved through techniques like load balancing and clustering [[6]].

4. **Load Balancing**: A method of distributing workloads across multiple systems or services to improve resource use, maximize throughput, and minimize response time [[5]].

5. **Clustering**: Connecting multiple computers to work together as a single system, thereby providing redundancy and improved performance [[5]].

6. **Backup**: A copy of data stored separately to protect against data loss. It can be a full backup, incremental backup, or differential backup [[9]].

7. **RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks)**: A data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for redundancy and performance [[8]].

8. **Snapshots**: A point-in-time capture of the state of a system or data, allowing for restoration to that exact state later [[10]].

9. **Journaling**: A method of keeping a log of changes to data that can be reapplied to restore data integrity after a failure [[9]].

10. **Disaster Recovery Sites**: Locations designated to restore operations after a disaster, which can be categorized as hot sites, warm sites, or cold sites based on their readiness [[19]].

11. **Physical Security**: Measures taken to protect the physical assets of an organization, including buildings, equipment, and other resources, from physical threats [[23]].

12. **Access Control Vestibule**: A security mechanism that requires authorization for entry through a pair of doors to prevent unauthorized access [[27]].

13. **Bollards**: Physical barriers designed to restrict vehicle access to certain areas [[25]].

14. **Sensors**: Devices that detect changes in the environment (e.g., motion, temperature) and can trigger alerts or actions in response [[31]].

15. **Video Surveillance**: The use of cameras to monitor and record activities in a specific area for security purposes [[30]].
