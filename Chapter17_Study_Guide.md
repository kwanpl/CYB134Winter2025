### Study Guide: Risk Management in Cybersecurity

#### 1. What are the key components that define risk in the cybersecurity domain?
**Answer:** Risk exists at the intersection of a threat and a corresponding vulnerability. It is defined as a combination of the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact if the threat materializes. [[1]]

#### 2. What are the categories of risks organizations face?
**Answer:** Organizations face various categories of risks, including:
- Financial Risk
- Reputational Risk
- Strategic Risk
- Operational Risk
- Compliance Risk [[2]]

#### 3. What is the difference between external and internal risks?
**Answer:** 
- **External Risks** originate from outside the organization, such as cyber adversaries or natural disasters.
- **Internal Risks** come from within the organization, including mistakes by authorized users or equipment failures. [[2]]

#### 4. What is the process of risk assessment?
**Answer:** Risk assessment involves evaluating two main factors:
- The likelihood of occurrence (probability) that a risk will occur.
- The magnitude of impact (financial cost) that the risk will have on the organization if it occurs. [[3]]

#### 5. What are the four strategies for managing risk?
**Answer:** The four strategies for managing risk are:
- **Risk Mitigation:** Applying security controls to reduce risk.
- **Risk Avoidance:** Changing business practices to eliminate risk.
- **Risk Transference:** Shifting the risk to another entity, often through insurance.
- **Risk Acceptance:** Acknowledging the risk and choosing to proceed without additional measures. [[10]]

#### 6. Explain the term "Residual Risk."
**Answer:** Residual risk is the level of risk that remains after an organization has implemented controls to mitigate, avoid, or transfer the inherent risk. [[15]]

#### 7. What is a Business Impact Analysis (BIA)?
**Answer:** A BIA is a formal process designed to identify mission-essential functions within an organization and the critical systems that support those functions. It evaluates potential impacts of various risks on operations. [[21]]

#### 8. What metrics are critical in a Business Impact Analysis?
**Answer:** The four key metrics in a BIA are:
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** [[21]]

#### 9. What is the purpose of a risk register?
**Answer:** A risk register is a tool used by risk management professionals to track risks facing the organization. It includes data such as risk owner, risk threshold, and key risk indicators (KRIs). [[17]]

#### 10. What are Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET)?
**Answer:** PETs are methods used to protect personal data. Techniques include:
- **De-identification:** Removing identifiable information from data.
- **Data masking:** Partially redacting sensitive information.
- **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive values with unique identifiers. [[29]]

#### 11. What is the "Right to Be Forgotten"?
**Answer:** The right to be forgotten allows individuals to request the deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer needed for its original purpose or if the individual withdraws consent. [[28]]

#### 12. How does the GDPR affect data protection?
**Answer:** The GDPR requires that organizations establish clear protocols for data privacy, including the designation of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and the implementation of rights such as the right to erasure. [[27]]

### Exam Essentials
- Understand the risk management strategies: mitigation, avoidance, transference, and acceptance.
- Be familiar with the concepts of inherent risk, residual risk, risk appetite, and risk threshold.
- Know the metrics used in a Business Impact Analysis.
- Recognize the importance of data privacy and the implications of regulations like the GDPR. 

This study guide encapsulates key topics on risk management in cybersecurity and should aid in preparing for exams and understanding fundamental concepts.
