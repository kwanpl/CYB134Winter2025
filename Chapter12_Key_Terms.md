1. **Zero Trust**: A security model that assumes no user or system is trusted by default, requiring continuous verification of identity and access rights to resources, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network [[15]].

2. **Honeypot**: A decoy system set up to attract attackers, allowing security professionals to monitor their activities and gather information about their tactics [[38]].

3. **Honeynet**: A network of honeypots designed to collect data about attacks, providing insights into the methods and tools used by attackers [[38]].

4. **Honeyfile**: A file placed on a system that appears valuable, used for intrusion detection by alerting administrators if accessed or exfiltrated [[38]].

5. **Honeytoken**: Data specifically designed to be attractive to attackers, allowing organizations to track unauthorized access or use [[38]].

6. **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)**: An attack where multiple systems are used to flood a target system with traffic, overwhelming it and causing service disruptions [[60]].

7. **Network Access Control (NAC)**: A security solution that enforces policies on devices attempting to connect to a network, ensuring only compliant devices are granted access [[18]].

8. **802.1X**: A network access control standard that uses port-based authentication to grant or deny devices access to a network [[19]].

9. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: A system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators [[31]].

10. **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: Similar to an IDS, but it can also take action to block or mitigate detected threats [[31]].

11. **Firewall**: A network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules [[34]].

12. **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**: A physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external services to an untrusted network, such as the internet [[14]].

13. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: A cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network, commonly used in web traffic [[24]].

14. **Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)**: A suite of extensions to DNS that adds security by allowing DNS responses to be verified for authenticity [[40]].

15. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: A strategy that employs software and hardware solutions to prevent sensitive data from being lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users [[39]].

16. **Malicious Code**: Software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise systems, including viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware [[60]].

17. **Reputation Services**: Tools that track and evaluate the behavior of IP addresses and domains to identify malicious activity [[12]].

18. **Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)**: A network architecture that combines WAN capabilities with comprehensive network security functions, enabling secure access to applications regardless of location [[12]].

19. **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**: A network management approach that allows network administrators to manage network services through abstraction of lower-level functionality [[12]].

20. **Logical Segmentation**: The practice of dividing a network into segments using software rather than physical separation, often through Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) [[9]].
