### Study Guide: Monitoring and Incident Response

#### Chapter 14: Monitoring and Incident Response

---

**1. What are the six steps of the incident response process?**

**Answer:** 
The six steps are:
1. **Preparation**: Building tools, processes, and procedures for incident response.
2. **Detection**: Identifying incidents by reviewing events and using indicators of compromise.
3. **Analysis**: Analyzing identified incidents to understand their impact and related events.
4. **Containment**: Preventing further damage by isolating the incident.
5. **Eradication**: Removing artifacts associated with the incident.
6. **Recovery**: Restoring systems and operations to normal. [[5]]

**2. What types of training exercises are recommended for incident response teams?**

**Answer:** 
The two major types of exercises are:
- **Tabletop exercises**: Discuss and walk through processes using hypothetical scenarios.
- **Simulations**: Conduct full-scale or targeted exercises that involve actual incident response procedures. [[8]]

**3. What is the purpose of threat hunting in incident response?**

**Answer:** 
Threat hunting helps organizations detect and analyze potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) that may suggest malicious activity or incidents. [[11]]

---

**4. Describe the concept of "Indicators of Compromise" (IoCs) and provide examples.**

**Answer:** 
Indicators of Compromise are signs that an incident may have occurred. Examples include:
- Account lockout due to brute-force attempts.
- Concurrent session usage from unusual locations.
- Resource consumption anomalies.
- Impossible travel patterns detected in user logins.
- Missing logs, which may indicate tampering. [[12]]

**5. What is the difference between an incident and an event?**

**Answer:** 
An **incident** is a violation of the organization's policies or security practices, while an **event** is an observable occurrence that may or may not signify an incident. [[3]]

---

**6. What role does a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system play in incident response?**

**Answer:** 
A SIEM system collects, aggregates, and analyzes log data from various sources to identify security events and incidents. It provides alerting, reporting, and correlation capabilities to help incident responders manage security incidents effectively. [[17]]

---

**7. What are some mitigation techniques used during an incident?**

**Answer:** 
Mitigation techniques include:
- **Application allow lists**: Only allowing approved applications to run.
- **Isolation**: Quarantining affected systems to prevent further damage.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously observing systems to validate remediation efforts. [[36]]

---

**8. Why is conducting a root cause analysis (RCA) important after an incident?**

**Answer:** 
RCA helps identify the underlying causes of an incident, ensuring that systemic issues are addressed to prevent future occurrences. It also feeds into the preparation phase of the incident response cycle, promoting continuous improvement. [[40]]

---

**9. What are the key components of an incident response plan?**

**Answer:** 
Key components include:
- Incident response policies.
- Communication plans.
- Stakeholder management plans.
- Business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
- Regular reviews and updates of the plans. [[9]]

---

**10. How does log aggregation and analysis support incident response?**

**Answer:** 
Log aggregation centralizes log data from various sources, allowing for easier analysis, correlation of events, and identification of patterns that may indicate security incidents. It helps responders piece together the timeline and context of an incident. [[22]]
