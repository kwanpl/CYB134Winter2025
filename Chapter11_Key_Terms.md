1. **Cryptographic Solutions**: Tools and technologies designed to secure data through encryption, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information. Examples include Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Hardware Security Module (HSM), and Key Management Systems (KMS) [[1]].

2. **Operating System Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in an operating system that attackers can exploit, which can arise from flaws in the OS itself, insecure default settings, or misconfigurations [[4]].

3. **Firmware**: Embedded software that allows hardware devices to function. Vulnerabilities in firmware can pose significant security risks as they may not be easily updated or removed [[5]].

4. **End-of-Life Hardware**: Devices that are no longer sold or supported by the manufacturer, leading to potential security issues as they no longer receive updates or patches [[6]].

5. **Antivirus and Antimalware Tools**: Software designed to detect, prevent, and remediate malware infections. These tools employ various detection techniques, including signature-based and heuristic-based methods [[11]].

6. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Tools that combine monitoring capabilities on endpoint devices with network monitoring to collect, correlate, and analyze security events [[14]].

7. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Technologies and processes used to prevent sensitive data from being lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. DLP tools monitor and control data access and transmission [[15]].

8. **Host-based Firewall**: A security tool integrated into an operating system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules [[17]].

9. **Hardening Techniques**: Processes and methods used to secure a system by reducing its attack surface, which can include disabling unnecessary services, changing default settings, and implementing security controls [[19]].

10. **Secure Boot**: A security standard that ensures a device boots using only software that is trusted by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) [[8]].

11. **Measured Boot**: A process that records the integrity of each component in the boot sequence and logs it for verification against known good states [[8]].

12. **Key Management System (KMS)**: A system used to manage cryptographic keys for encryption and decryption processes, often implemented in cloud environments [[10]].

13. **Configuration Management**: The process of maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state to ensure security and compliance [[28]].

14. **Decommissioning**: The process of removing a device or system from service, ensuring that no sensitive data remains and that it is properly disposed of [[43]].

15. **Asset Management**: The practice of tracking and managing assets throughout their life cycle to ensure security and compliance, including procurement, inventory, and decommissioning [[42]].
