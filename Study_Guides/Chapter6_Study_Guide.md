### Study Guide: Application Security

#### Chapter 6 Questions and Answers

1. **What are the types of application vulnerabilities?**
   - **Answer:** Various types of vulnerabilities include memory injection, buffer overflow, race conditions (Time-of-check, Target of evaluation, Time-of-use), malicious updates, SQL injection (SQLi), and cross-site scripting (XSS) [[1]].

2. **What techniques can be used to analyze indicators of malicious activity in applications?**
   - **Answer:** Techniques include identifying application attacks such as injection, buffer overflow, replay, privilege escalation, forgery, and directory traversal [[1]].

3. **What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**
   - **Answer:** The SDLC describes the steps in a model for software development throughout its life, including phases like planning, requirements definition, design, coding, testing, training and transition, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning [[3]].

4. **What are secure coding practices according to OWASP?**
   - **Answer:** OWASP's top proactive controls include defining security requirements, leveraging security frameworks, securing database access, encoding and escaping data, validating all inputs, implementing digital identity, enforcing access controls, protecting data everywhere, implementing security logging and monitoring, and handling all errors and exceptions [[9]].

5. **What is the purpose of input validation in application security?**
   - **Answer:** Input validation helps prevent a wide range of problems, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). It verifies that user input matches the expected format before processing [[39]].

6. **What are the two common forms of cross-site scripting (XSS)?**
   - **Answer:** The two common forms are reflected XSS, where the attack is reflected off a web server, and stored/persistent XSS, where the attack is stored on the server [[33]].

7. **What is the significance of code signing?**
   - **Answer:** Code signing provides assurance that the code comes from a trusted source and has not been altered, protecting against malicious updates [[44]].

8. **Explain the concept of race conditions in application security.**
   - **Answer:** Race conditions occur when the security of a code segment depends on the sequence of events within the system, which can lead to vulnerabilities if not managed properly [[52]].

9. **What is a web application firewall (WAF)?**
   - **Answer:** A WAF is a security measure that sits in front of a web server and inspects incoming traffic to prevent malicious requests from reaching the server [[41]].

10. **What are the benefits of automation and scripting in security operations?**
    - **Answer:** Benefits include efficiency and time savings, enforcing baselines, standardizing configurations, scaling securely, retaining employees, reducing reaction times, and serving as a workforce multiplier [[56]].

### Summary
This study guide covers various aspects of application security, including vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, the SDLC, and the importance of input validation and automation. Understanding these concepts is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to protect applications from potential threats.
