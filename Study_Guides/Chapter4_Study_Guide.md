### Study Guide: Social Engineering and Password Attacks

#### Questions and Answers

1. **What is social engineering?**
   - **Answer:** Social engineering is the practice of manipulating individuals through various strategies to achieve desired actions, such as disclosing information or granting access to systems [[2]].

2. **What are the key principles of social engineering?**
   - **Answer:** The key principles include:
     - **Authority:** People tend to obey those who appear knowledgeable or in charge.
     - **Intimidation:** Scaring or bullying individuals into compliance.
     - **Consensus:** Leveraging social proof to persuade targets.
     - **Scarcity:** Making something seem more desirable due to limited availability.
     - **Familiarity:** Using a connection with the individual or organization.
     - **Trust:** Building a connection to encourage desired actions.
     - **Urgency:** Creating a sense of immediate action needed [[2-3]].

3. **What are phishing, vishing, and smishing?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to acquire sensitive information, typically through email.
     - **Vishing:** Phishing conducted via voice or voicemail messages.
     - **Smishing:** Phishing attempts via SMS (text messages) [[4-5]].

4. **What is spear phishing and whaling?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Spear Phishing:** Targets specific individuals or groups within an organization.
     - **Whaling:** Similar to spear phishing but specifically targets high-profile individuals such as executives [[4]].

5. **What is Business Email Compromise (BEC)?**
   - **Answer:** BEC is a scam that uses seemingly legitimate email addresses to conduct fraud, such as invoice scams or data theft [[7]].

6. **What is pretexting in social engineering?**
   - **Answer:** Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to justify the approach to an individual, usually to make the impersonation more credible [[8]].

7. **What are watering hole attacks?**
   - **Answer:** Watering hole attacks compromise websites that the target frequently visits, allowing attackers to stage attacks when the victim visits the site [[8]].

8. **What is typosquatting?**
   - **Answer:** Typosquatting occurs when attackers register misspelled or similar URLs to legitimate sites to trick users into visiting them [[9]].

9. **What are brute-force attacks?**
   - **Answer:** Brute-force attacks attempt to gain access by trying every possible password until the correct one is found [[10]].

10. **What is password spraying?**
    - **Answer:** Password spraying is a type of brute-force attack that tries a single password or a small set of passwords against many accounts [[10]].

11. **What is a rainbow table?**
    - **Answer:** A rainbow table is a precomputed database of hash values used to quickly lookup corresponding plain-text passwords [[11]].

12. **What are some common defenses against social engineering attacks?**
    - **Answer:** Common defenses include awareness training for employees, technical filtering of phishing attempts, and implementing multifactor authentication [[4-5]].

13. **What is the TRUST process recommended by CISA for countering misinformation?**
    - **Answer:**
      1. Tell your story.
      2. Ready your team.
      3. Understand and assess misinformation/disinformation.
      4. Strategize response.
      5. Track outcomes [[6]].
