### Study Guide: Malware Types and Mitigation

#### Questions and Answers

1. **What is malware?**
   - **Answer:** Malware is a wide range of software intentionally designed to cause harm to systems, networks, or users, gather information, or provide illicit access [[1]].

2. **What are the main types of malware covered in the CompTIA Security+ exam?**
   - **Answer:** The main types of malware include ransomware, Trojans, worms, spyware, bloatware, viruses, keyloggers, logic bombs, and rootkits [[1]].

3. **What distinguishes ransomware from other types of malware?**
   - **Answer:** Ransomware takes control of a computer, encrypts files, and demands a ransom for their release. It often spreads through phishing campaigns and can threaten to expose sensitive information [[2]].

4. **How do Trojans function, and what is a common indicator of their presence?**
   - **Answer:** Trojans are disguised as legitimate software and require user interaction to install. Common indicators include signatures for the specific malware applications or command and control system hostnames and IP addresses [[4]].

5. **What are worms, and how do they spread?**
   - **Answer:** Worms are a type of malware that spreads automatically without user interaction, often exploiting vulnerabilities in services or networks [[7]].

6. **What is spyware, and what are its common indicators of compromise?**
   - **Answer:** Spyware is designed to gather information about users, systems, or organizations. Common IoCs include remote-access indicators, known software file fingerprints, and malicious processes disguised as system processes [[9]].

7. **What is the difference between bloatware and spyware?**
   - **Answer:** Bloatware is unwanted software pre-installed by manufacturers, while spyware is intended to gather information about users. Bloatware is not malicious but can be vulnerable to exploitation [[11]].

8. **What are the characteristics of a computer virus?**
   - **Answer:** Viruses are malicious programs that self-copy and self-replicate once activated, requiring specific infection mechanisms to spread, such as email attachments or thumb drives [[12]].

9. **What is a keylogger, and how does it operate?**
   - **Answer:** A keylogger is a program that captures keystrokes from a keyboard to gather sensitive information. It can capture other inputs like mouse movements or credit card swipes [[14]].

10. **How can organizations mitigate the risks associated with malware?**
    - **Answer:** Mitigation techniques include using antivirus and antimalware tools, implementing security awareness training, controlling software installations, and maintaining effective backup systems [[20]].

11. **What is a logic bomb, and how can it be identified?**
    - **Answer:** A logic bomb is a piece of code embedded in other software that activates under specific conditions. It is typically identified through code review [[16]].

12. **What are rootkits, and what challenges do they present for detection?**
    - **Answer:** Rootkits are designed to allow attackers to maintain access to a system while hiding their presence. Detection is challenging because the infected system cannot be trusted [[17]].
