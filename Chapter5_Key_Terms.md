1. **Vulnerability Management**: A program that identifies, prioritizes, and remediates vulnerabilities in an organization's environment. It includes activities such as vulnerability scanning and remediation workflows [[3]].

2. **Vulnerability Scan**: A process that detects new vulnerabilities in systems by examining their configurations and software versions [[3]].

3. **Penetration Testing**: An assessment tool that simulates an attack on a system to test its security controls by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities [[2]].

4. **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**: A standardized approach for measuring and describing the severity of security-related software flaws. It uses a score from 0 to 10 to indicate vulnerability severity [[22]].

5. **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**: A list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities that includes an ID number, description, and reference [[17]].

6. **False Positive**: A report generated by a vulnerability scanner indicating that a vulnerability exists when it does not [[31]].

7. **False Negative**: A report generated by a vulnerability scanner indicating that a vulnerability does not exist when it actually does [[31]].

8. **Responsible Disclosure Program**: A framework that allows security researchers to report vulnerabilities to the vendor responsible for the product, fostering collaboration for timely remediation [[54]].

9. **Bug Bounty Program**: A type of responsible disclosure program that incentivizes security researchers with financial rewards for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities [[54]].

10. **Security Assessment**: A comprehensive review of the security of a system or application, which identifies vulnerabilities and makes recommendations for remediation [[55]].

11. **Security Audit**: A formal examination of an organizationâ€™s security controls conducted by independent auditors to ensure they are effective [[56]].

12. **Attack Vector**: The method by which an attacker gains access to a system to exploit a vulnerability [[23]].

13. **Attack Complexity**: A metric that describes the difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability [[24]].

14. **Privileges Required**: The type of access an attacker needs to exploit a vulnerability, indicating if administrative privileges are necessary [[25]].

15. **User Interaction**: A metric that describes whether successful exploitation of a vulnerability requires action by a user other than the attacker [[26]].

16. **Compensating Controls**: Security measures that are put in place to mitigate the risk associated with a vulnerability when direct fixes (like patches) cannot be applied [[60]].

17. **Threat Hunting**: The proactive searching for evidence of cyber threats within an organization's environment, based on the assumption that attackers may have already breached security [[44]].

18. **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**: Guidelines that define the scope, limitations, and expectations for a penetration test [[47]].
