# Study Guide for Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

## Chapter 2: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

### Key Concepts and Questions

---

### 1. What are the common types of threat actors?

**Answer:** The common types of threat actors include:
- Nation-state actors
- Unskilled attackers (script kiddies)
- Hacktivists
- Insider threats
- Organized crime
- Shadow IT [[1]].

---

### 2. How can threat actors be classified?

**Answer:** Threat actors can be classified based on:
- **Internal vs. External:** Internal actors are within the organization, while external actors are outside.
- **Level of Sophistication/Capability:** This ranges from unskilled attackers to advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- **Resources/Funding:** This includes the financial and technical resources available to them.
- **Motivations:** Motivations can vary from financial gain to political beliefs, ethical hacking, or revenge [[2]].

---

### 3. What are some common motivations behind cyberattacks?

**Answer:** Common motivations include:
- Data exfiltration
- Espionage
- Service disruption
- Blackmail
- Financial gain
- Philosophical/political beliefs
- Ethical hacking
- Revenge
- Disruption/chaos
- War [[2]].

---

### 4. What are common threat vectors?

**Answer:** Common threat vectors include:
- Email (e.g., phishing)
- Short Message Service (SMS)
- Instant messaging (IM)
- Voice calls (vishing)
- Removable devices (e.g., USB drives)
- Vulnerable software
- Unsupported systems and applications
- Unsecure networks (wireless, wired, Bluetooth)
- Open service ports [[1]].

---

### 5. Define and differentiate between the types of hackers based on "hats."

**Answer:**
- **White-hat hackers:** Authorized individuals who seek to discover and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Black-hat hackers:** Unauthorized individuals with malicious intent who compromise security for personal gain.
- **Gray-hat hackers:** Individuals who operate without authorization but intend to inform the target about vulnerabilities [[4]].

---

### 6. What is Shadow IT, and what risks does it pose?

**Answer:** Shadow IT refers to technology solutions procured by employees without the approval of the IT department. It poses risks by placing sensitive information in the hands of external vendors and can lead to data breaches if not properly managed [[12]].

---

### 7. What role do insider threats play in cybersecurity?

**Answer:** Insider threats involve individuals within the organization who misuse their access to information and systems to attack the organization. Their motivations can range from financial gain to personal grievances, and they often have significant knowledge and access that external attackers lack [[11]].

---

### 8. Explain the significance of threat intelligence.

**Answer:** Threat intelligence is critical for cybersecurity as it helps organizations understand the threat landscape, identify potential risks, and develop appropriate defenses. It includes data on vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise (IoCs), and the latest attack techniques [[19]].

---

### 9. What are zero-day attacks?

**Answer:** Zero-day attacks exploit vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor and for which no patches are available. These attacks are particularly dangerous as they can go undetected until a vulnerability is exploited [[10]].

---

### 10. Describe the importance of vulnerability management.

**Answer:** Vulnerability management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities within an organizationâ€™s systems. It is essential for maintaining security and preventing potential attacks from exploiting these weaknesses [[11]].

---

### 11. What are some methods to gather threat intelligence?

**Answer:** Methods to gather threat intelligence include:
- Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Threat feeds from commercial vendors
- Vulnerability databases
- Dark web monitoring [[20]].

---

### 12. How can organizations defend against cyber threats?

**Answer:** Organizations can defend against cyber threats by:
- Implementing robust security policies
- Conducting regular security training for employees
- Using threat intelligence to stay informed about emerging threats
- Utilizing intrusion detection systems and firewalls
- Regularly updating and patching software [[30]].
