**Q1: What are the three major cloud service models?**

**A1:** The three major cloud service models are:
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Offers basic building blocks of technology infrastructure, allowing customers to manage and configure computing, storage, and networking resources.
2. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Provides fully managed applications running in the cloud, where the provider handles everything from operation to performance management.
3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform for customers to run their own applications while the provider manages the infrastructure and execution environment [[6]], [[8]].

**Q2: Describe the four major cloud deployment models.**

**A2:** The four major cloud deployment models are:
1. **Public Cloud:** Infrastructure is available to any customer in a multitenant environment (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure).
2. **Private Cloud:** Infrastructure is provisioned for use by a single customer, managed either by the organization or a third party.
3. **Community Cloud:** Shares infrastructure among several organizations with common concerns (e.g., security, compliance).
4. **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines elements from public, private, and community clouds to provide flexibility [[12]], [[13]].

**Q3: Explain the shared responsibility model of cloud security.**

**A3:** In the shared responsibility model of cloud security, responsibilities for security are divided between the cloud service provider and the customer. The provider is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure (hardware, networking), while the customer is responsible for the security of their data, applications, and operating systems. This division varies by service model: in IaaS, the customer manages more aspects, while in SaaS, the provider handles most of the security [[17]], [[18]].

**Q4: What are two major vulnerabilities related to virtualization?**

**A4:** The two major vulnerabilities related to virtualization are:
1. **Virtual Machine (VM) Escape:** This occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain access to the hypervisor and other VMs on the same host.
2. **Resource Reuse:** This happens when cloud providers reassign hardware resources from one customer to another without properly erasing the previous customer's data, potentially leading to data leaks [[38]].

---

**Q5: What are some key benefits of cloud computing?**

**A5:** Key benefits of cloud computing include:
1. **On-demand self-service:** Resources can be provisioned as needed without human intervention.
2. **Scalability:** Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.
3. **Elasticity:** Capacity can automatically adjust to meet changing needs, optimizing costs.
4. **Measured service:** Users pay only for the resources they consume [[4]], [[6]].

**Q6: What is the purpose of Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs)?**

**A6:** CASBs serve as intermediaries between cloud service users and providers. They help monitor user activity and enforce security policies across various cloud services, ensuring consistent security management [[41]].

---

**Q7: How do security groups function in cloud networking?**

**A7:** Security groups act as virtual firewalls for cloud resources, defining permissible network traffic rules. They operate at the network layer of the OSI model, allowing users to control inbound and outbound traffic to their resources [[33]].

---

**Q8: What are some key security considerations for cloud storage?**

**A8:** Key security considerations for cloud storage include:
1. Properly setting permissions to control access to stored data.
2. Considering high availability and durability options to mitigate data loss.
3. Using encryption to protect sensitive data [[30]].
